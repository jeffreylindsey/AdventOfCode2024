# Advent of Code 2024


Here's my go at [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).


## Log


### December 3rd

#### Day 0

Setting up a repository and project, and giving auth to Advent of Code.

Using C++20, and setting up a project using Visual Studio's native unit tests, since that worked pretty well when I did that last time, for AOC 2021.

Starting with some existing template code from AOC 2021.

#### Day 1

Ah yes, I remember now.  The first real challenge of doing AOC in C++ is parsing.

Going with a `std::priority_queue` because that seems to be the quickest and easiest way to get both lists in sorted order.

Part 1 success on the first try!  Yes, it's the first day, but I'm still excited.

Part 2 done pretty simply with a map.


### December 4th

#### Day 2

I have 15 minutes, can I get day 2 done in that amount of time?

Had a couple minor mistakes, one with parsing, and the other with checking for whether the levels were increasing or decreasing, but got part 1 to pass!  It took longer than 15 minutes, so I'll have to come back to part 2 later.
