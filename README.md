# Advent of Code 2024


Here's my go at [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).


## Log


### December 3rd

Day 0!  Setting up a repository and project, and giving auth to Advent of Code.

Using C++20, and setting up a project using Visual Studio's native unit tests, since that worked pretty well when I did that last time, for AOC 2021.

Starting with some existing template code from AOC 2021.
